# xmpp-onion-map
A list of XMPP servers available as hidden services for use with the Prosody server and mod_onions

The repository contains two important files:

 * [v2-onions-map.lua](v2-onions-map.lua) -- for Tor Onion Addresses in the V2 format
 * [v3-onions-map.lua](v3-onions-map.lua) -- for Tor Onion Addresses in the V3 format

The repository was originally a fork from https://github.com/nickcalyx/xmpp-onion-map. Over time I looked for more Onion Addresses so my repo grew and I decided to make it an own repository.
